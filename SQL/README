Farming Vendor Management System
CIS 344 – Spring 2026

Project Overview
     The Farming Vendor Management System is a relational database that models how a farmer’s market works. It stores information about farmers, products, customers, transactions, and itemized sales. The goal of this project was to design the system from the ground up, create ER diagrams, build the database in MySQL Workbench, and write SQL queries to test and analyze the data.
     The sample data uses names inspired by One Piece to make the project more engaging while keeping the structure realistic.

Features
     The system can store farmer information, product details, customer records, and transaction history.
     It supports itemized sales, foreign key relationships, and multi‑table JOIN queries for analysis.
     The database is fully normalized and enforces referential integrity.

Database Structure
  The system includes five main tables:
      Farmer – stores farmer and farm details
      Product – stores product names, categories, measurements and prices
      Customer – stores customer contact information
      Transaction – stores each purchase made by a customer
      Transaction_Per_Item – stores each item inside a transaction, including quantity, price at sale, and the farmer who supplied it
      Foreign keys connect the tables so the system behaves like a real farmer’s market.

ER Diagrams
   This project includes two ER diagrams in the SQL folder:
       Chen ER Diagram – conceptual model showing entities, attributes, and relationships
       UML ER Diagram – logical model created in MySQL Workbench model with crow’s‑foot notation
  

How to Run the SQL
    - Open MySQL Workbench
    - Load the file named farming_vendor_db.sql
    - Run the script to create all tables and insert sample data
    - Use the provided queries in the file to explore and test the database

Repository Contents
   Folder SQL
         Project Report.doc - contains the documentation process
         contains Chen and UML diagrams
         farming_vendor_db.sql – SQL script for creating tables and inserting data
         FarmingVendor.mwb – MySQL Workbench file
         Project Final Report.pdf – project report including challenges and outcomes
         Project.pdf – project overview and instructions

Notes
The sample data uses One Piece characters for fun, but the database design follows proper relational rules.
JOIN queries were used to test and validate the system and to show how the tables connect.
